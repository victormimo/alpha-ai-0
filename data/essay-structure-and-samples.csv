1,"From a very young age, I started going to overnight camp with my best friends. As I grew older, I began to attend for the whole summer and experienced many enjoyable activities. After eight years of being a camper, I knew I wanted to take the position of a Camp Counselor. During grade 10, I applied to be a Counselor in training (CIT) for the following summer and was successfully selected. After that summer, I applied to be a counselor, a position that only some CITS are chosen for. As a counselor, I have grown into a more mature woman and demonstrated a leadership role amongst the younger campers in camp.
As a CIT, I experienced my first leadership experience within my camp community. Being a CIT came with responsibilities including, facilitating two girls' cabins, for ages 9-10 and 13-14. Additionally, I was responsible for managing water activities like sailing and waterskiing. Despite having little experience with sailing, I took the initiative to spend time beyond my role, learning and practicing, so I could best support the campers around me. As a CIT, I worked in a team with fellow CIT’s to plan the annual Midnight Madness event. We worked together to delegate tasks for this special event that all campers look forward to. Specifically, the role of painting murals and preparing food was a task I completed, alongside a team. 
Once I became a counselor, I was given even more responsibilities. I had to be a leader not only for the campers but also for the CIT’s. Additionally, in order to be a counselor on water activity, I had to pass my bronze cross-certification, which I took the initiative to complete prior to taking on this role. While I achieved a great extent as a counselor my biggest achievement was making an impact on a 10-year-old named Maya. Maya was excluded from the cabin group and was not enjoying camp as much as she could have been. I supported her by doing the activities she was hesitant of doing and showing her ways to be more involved. By the end of my contributions, she was able to feel more comfortable with the girls in the cabin. 
Overall, being a counselor has shown me the importance of carrying a leadership role within my community. I exhibited a kind of confidence in myself that I didn’t know I had prior to entering this role. I worked well with other counselors which allowed our campers to have a better experience and admire our sense of commitment. Although some of the days were challenging, I knew that I was making a positive experience for my campers by providing them with the exciting experiences that camp has to offer. By taking initiative in the waterfront activities, I learned more about myself and what I am capable of doing. This allowed me to exceed a sense of resilience within my camp community as well as inside the HBA program and beyond. "
2,"The self-empowerment I achieve from playing basketball is unlike anything I've ever felt. Six years ago, I played basketball recreationally then switched to competitive for 3 years throughout elementary school. Once I began high school, I was excited to start playing again and experience what it’s like to be a part of a school team. However, this all changed due to the pandemic, and no teams operating during grades 10 and 11. When grade 12 came around, I knew it would be an even more competitive selection process as the last few years were canceled. I tried out and successfully made the varsity girls' basketball team which has been a pivotal part of my grade 12 year and has grown me into the leader I am today. 
When I joined the team, I knew I was not going to be the star player after years of not playing competitively. However, this did not stop me from being one of the hardest workers on the team. I was never a starter, yet, I always knew the value of working as a team. I took the initiative to work out at the gym to build my stamina and get to the position I wanted, which successfully paid off when my coach put on me as a starter. While I was not the leader in talent, I led with a positive attitude on and off the court. I was a supportive and encouraging teammate which led to our team's success.
The adjustment of joining a varsity team was a big change for me after not playing for many years. As a new team, we had to learn to communicate during practices, as well as work together in a cooperative manner. Our coach always told us that winning would never come from working as individuals but rather from a strong worth ethic as a team. Although it was challenging at first, all of our practices paid off and gave us the opportunity to play in the Joseph Weiner Tournament in Baltimore. Though we were unaware of the other teams' skill levels, that did not stop our resilience on the court. Our hard work collaborating as a team was beneficial as we exceeded our goal and won all seven of our games. 
Even though I may not be the most talented player, these basketball experiences have taught me the importance of being a leader. Despite some of us not being starters, we all led the team by working together and encouraging one another on the court. We provided a group effort of positive contributions that led the team to their deserved victory. These experiences on the court have made me realize how much of a leader I was toward my team and how I can carry that into my life. At the Richard Ivey School of Business, I hope to convey the same work ethic and step up as a leader when necessary.

3,"Throughout my childhood, my grandmother shared stories about her life in India, where she struggled to balance taking care of her siblings with attending school. I have so much gratitude for my opportunities and the advantages they bring me, which inspired my interest in helping to create equal access to education. I applied and was selected as a volunteer for Aim for Seva (AFS), a non-profit organization that works to increase the accessibility of education for young people across India. AFS works to bridge the education gap by making schools more accessible to children in rural areas. They provide facilities that allow students to attend school for free and without interruptions.
After one year of volunteering, I applied to be co-chair of the youth committee and was selected due to my demonstrated dedication to the charity. My experience in this role has developed me as a leader while also allowing me to encourage more young people to join the cause. As co-chair, I am responsible for recruiting volunteers for the annual fundraising gala, delegating tasks among volunteers, and organizing the volunteers for key events. The Backpack Project is one of our most important initiatives where we purchase school supplies and backpacks that will be made into bundles and sent to India. Our hard work paid off as we raised $3000, enough for 150 backpacks, a 200% increase from the previous year. 
Additionally, I lead the group in brainstorming sessions, for fundraisers and new initiatives. To make this brainstorming effective, I took the initiative to build trust with the volunteers, which helped to facilitate better communication and led to more ideas being shared. Specifically, our team reflected on how the students we support are far away from their homes and families. This inspired us to start The Cloud Project, a brand new initiative collecting and donating comfort supplies including blankets, pillows, and mattresses. 
As co-chair, I have gained a deeper understanding of myself and my values while developing new skills. I have learned that I am passionate about enacting social change, at home and abroad. As a leader, I now know that taking initiative and working with a team can lead to innovative ideas, like the cloud project, as well as faster problem-solving. I have learned that leadership is not about me, it is about the people I am leading. As a leader, to achieve great things you need to establish a positive relationship with your team. After conducting some research, I have discovered the Aim to Educate group at Western, which is affiliated with AFS. I plan to get involved with this group, not only as a volunteer but as a member of the executive committee. Aim for Seva will always stay with me as I try to enact change at Western University and beyond."
4,"Throughout the eighth grade, I observed Student Council meetings as they were open to all students. In these meetings, I witnessed students from high school working as a collective to enact positive change in the school community. I was inspired by these leaders and wanted to create an impact just as they did. In grade eleven, I began my path toward this goal by applying for the grade eleven Student Council Representative. I was elected by my peers and acted as the grade eleven representative on our student council. In this role, I created positive change and wanted to keep this momentum going. At the end of grade eleven, I applied for the role of graduating class president. Due to the trust I built during my first year on the student council, I was elected as the graduating class president.
In this leadership role, I am responsible for a number of initiatives. First, the graduating class donation where I facilitate student engagement while striving to reach our fundraising goal. Next, I am the treasurer for the student council, where I organize student council finances, while also being the grade twelve representative on the council. Additionally, I oversee all graduating class decision-making, including graduation technicalities, group donations, and class dress code.
One of my first priorities as president was spearheading the highly anticipated grad hoodies. Each year, the class comes together to decide on a quote to put on the hoodie. This quote is meant to represent the entire graduating class. It was important for every student to have input, which led me to implement a voting system. I did so in two steps: first, through a poll where quotes could be submitted, then a vote to determine the most popular quote. Additionally, to plan, order, and distribute the hoodies as efficiently as possible, my co-president and I delegated tasks. I was responsible for the quote and communicating our progress to the advising teacher, while my co-chair was tasked with selecting the colour and type of sweater. As a result of our teamwork, not only was the quote voting system well received, but we completed the graduation hoodie project the earliest it has ever been done.
As student council treasurer, I also take a leadership role in the Thanksgiving food drive. This year, the student council leaders, including myself, were away on a school trip during the drive. This left it in the hands of the new members of the council. However, we worked together to ensure these members had the resources needed to run a successful food drive. As a result, the drive was a huge success and we saw record amounts of donations.
My role as graduating class president has taught me the importance of initiative and inspiration while shaping me into a stronger leader. I plan to continue to take on new leadership opportunities where I will utilize these skills to increase efficiency and communication in any role I end up in."
